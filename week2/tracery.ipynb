    "The syntax for a variable is `[]` and you should put it inside the #origin# rule to be able to access it everywhere else in your grammar. This is similar to the concept of global variable.\n",

    "\n",

    "- `.capitalize`: to capitalize the first letter\n",
    "- `.`\n",
    "- `.a`: add `a` or `an` before a word\n",
    "- `.s`: plural forms\n",
    "- `.ed`: simple past tense\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use the modifiers by adding `.a` inside the `#` signs and after the name of the rule. For example, for rule `#noun#`, we can add `.a` like `#noun.a#`.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also add multiple modifiers for the same rule. Pay attention to the order when you add multiple modifiers. In the example above, we first added `.a` to `#myNoun#`, then a second modifier `.capitalize` so that it capitalize `a` or `an` instead of the word itself.\n",
    "\n",

You know, the hooded woman who never moans when they see the earth. Well, I was walking with the hooded woman, when we both saw this sky. Glistening, black...well, more of an indigoish black. We backed away because as we legally know, skies are illegal. That was the last we saw of it. And now, the weather. Music plays. Distorted mariachi vocals reverberates into dissonance. You recall the future and pain. You know, I miss the sky. It was just beautiful. I mean, really perfect, for a sky. When the time comes, I hope it comes back. We'll see it, rising, orange...well, more of a blackish purple. But it'll be back. I guess, in the end. If not, but it hasn't always been that way. ...Goodnight, Night Vale, goodnight.\n"
